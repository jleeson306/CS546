This Final Project is not yet finished, it is still in progress. This is a group collaberation between me, Nick Quidas, Cassie Bell, and Leo Ouyang.



WaterBðŸ’§y is a website focused on documenting the many aspects of a healthy lifestyle, including various physical activities, but with a large focus on water and hydration. This website's goal will be to help a user log and track their various health stats and allow a user to read that information in a simple and easy fasion. As it is often easy to forget, it will help users make sure their water consumption is up to snuff with the rest of their activity. Users can also view leaderboards to see how their water consumption fairs compared to other users and join teams to build camaraderie and meet fellow water enthusiasts.
